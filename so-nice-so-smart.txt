[Verse]

F                      C  
I was quiet as a mouse when i snuck into your house 
F                                 C
and took roofies with your spouse in a nit and out a louse
F                               C
and lice are lousy all the time they suck your blood drink your wine
F                                C                          F
say shut up and quit your crying give it time and you'll be fine


[Chorus]

Bb        C        F         Dm
you're so nice and you're so smart
                   C              F         Dm
you're such a good friend i hafta break your heart
                  C                  F              Dm 
I tell you that i love you then i'll tear your world apart
                      C               F
just pretend i didn't tear your world apart


[Verse]

F                                   C
I like boys with strong convictions and convicts with perfect diction
F                              C
underdogs with good intentions amputees with stamp collections
F                                 C                            
plywood skinboards ride the ocean salty noses suntan lotion
F                      C       
always seriously jokin and rambunctiously soft-spoken
F                                   C
i like boys that like their mothers and i have a thing for brothers
F                                               C
but they always wait til we're under the covers to say i'm sure glad we're 
    F
not lovers


[Chorus]

Bb         C        F         Dm
you're so nice and you're so smart
                   C              F         Dm
you're such a good friend i hafta break your heart
                  C                  F              Dm 
I tell you that i love you then i'll tear your world apart
                      C               F
just pretend i didn't tear your world apart

[Bridge]

Bb

When i wear it i feel cute
